## Description
<p> This application was created to plan and visualise a wokrout ahead of time. Featurres involved include creating a workout that has a list of exercises. The exercises type can be created as cardio or strength. Cardios inputs include exercise name, distance, time and intensity. Strengths inputs include exercise weight, sets and reps. Other features include being able to view a summary of your workouts in a styled card displaying the workout name, when it was created and a list of the workouts exercise names. Another page is a detailed version of your workouts where you can see all the workouts and exercises values not just their names. Each workout card on these pages has a view button which will then display that single exercise. This is where you can press the edit button and either edit the workout name and exercises. There is also a delete button when editting that will delete the workout.
